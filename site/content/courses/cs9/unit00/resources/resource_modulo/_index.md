## Modulo
Python has many operators that allow you to perform calculations with values. You've probably
seen and used the basic ones like `+`(add), `-` (subtract), `*` (multiply), and `/` (divide).

However, Python has some other less common opertors that can be really helpful.

One such operator is the modulo operator (`%`). This operator takes two values, divides them,
and returns the remainder of the division. Try out the following operations using modulo to
get an idea for how it works:

| Calculation | Result |
|-------------|--------|
| `5%3`       |        |
| `3%3`       |        |
| `6%2`       |        |
| `0%6`       |        |
| `5%0`       |        |
