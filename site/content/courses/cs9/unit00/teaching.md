## Teaching

Working within the context of drawing, students practice building up complex programs from simple ones. We’ll use Python’s turtle library, and use our exported SVGs to cut things on the laser cutter/cnc. Loosely inspired by Chris’s Python drawing unit from GMS (this links to the Scratch drawing assignment; further up on the page are lessons translating this into Python). Programming: Imperative programming; Basics of syntax; functions; decomposition and code reuse. Introductory debugging strategies.
