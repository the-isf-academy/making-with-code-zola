## Case Study: Lunch Polling Application 

**What problem is it solving?**
The ISF Cafeterias produce a significant amount of food waste as a result of uneaten lunches. Not all lunch options are created equal. There are some options that student and faculty favor over other options. However, without a system to regulate production, excess lunches are produced. 

**What solution does it provide?** 
The lunch polling app provides an easy way to collect data on lunch option popularity by allowing students and faculty to rate options on a daily basis. Thus, allowing Sodexo to make more educated food production decisions. 

**Who will benefit from the service?**
The primary stakeholders are students, teachers, Sodexo, and the environment. Students and teachers will benefit from an increased number of enjoyable lunches. Sodexo will benefit by making data driven purchasing decisions. The environment will benefit from decreased food waste.
