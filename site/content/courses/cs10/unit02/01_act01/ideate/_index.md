# Ideate

In this stage we will focus on outlining the web applications through a human centered design process. 


## Brainstorming 

Throughout this Act, brainstorming is key. Especially at this early stage of development, it's important to generate a large quantity of ideas without fear of judgement. 

Here are some tips for quality brainstorming sessions. Although we may not be in person, Jam boards are a great resource to replicate the in-person experience. 

> **1. Defer judgement.** You never know where a good idea is going to come from. The key is to make everyone feel like they can say the idea on their mind and allow others to build on it.
>
> **2. Encourage wild ideas.** Wild ideas can often give rise to creative leaps. When devising ideas that are wacky or out there, we tend to imagine what we want without the constraints of technology or materials.
>
> **3. Build on the ideas of others.** Being positive and building on the ideas of others take some skill. In conversation, we try to use “ yes, and...” instead of “but.”
>
> **4. Stay focused on the topic.** Try to keep the discussion on target, otherwise you may diverge beyond the scope of what you’re trying to design for.
>
> **5. One conversation at a time.** Your team is far more likely to build on an idea and make a creative leap if everyone is paying full attention.
>
> **6. Be visual.** In Brainstorms we put our ideas on Post-its and then put them on a wall. Nothing gets an idea across faster than a sketch.
>
> **7. Go for quantity.** Aim for as many new ideas as possible. In a good
session, up to 100 ideas are generated in 60 minutes. Crank the ideas out quickly and build on the best ones.

## Define the Problem 

We'll start by brainstorming current problems faced by members of the ISF community. This could be specific to students, teachers, or parents. It could be specific to only Grade 10s or it could be applicable to all secondary students. It could be applicable to a single course or an entire department. As members of this community you are uniquely positioned to identify areas for improvement.  

A few questions to consider... 
- Where are points of friction or frustration in your life as a student? For a teacher? A parent? A local community member? 
- What are potential areas of improvement for a teacher, a parent, or local community member?  
- Anymore questions???

## Research

In human centered design, empathizing with the intended stakeholders is a key step in the ideation phase. By imaging how individuals think, feel, and behave in light of the problem, you can better understand the root of the issue. With a more diverse outlook on the problem, you are better positioned to generate a quality solution. 

> Researchers explored how cognitive empathy can aid in creativity whilst also leading to new and productive ideas. 
>
> "... we propose that managers interested in fueling creativity
will find it advantageous to create conditions that
support prosocial motivation and perspective taking...
These conditions can enhance prosocial motivation
and perspective taking by enabling employees to
empathize with others’ needs and become more
aware of the difference that their ideas can make in
others’ lives."

Your research to be in the form of interviews and/or observations. You will record your notes in your Ideation Google Doc. 

A few questions to consider...
- Who will benefit from a solution to your problem? 
- Who are the key stakeholders?
- What are the needs and motivations of the stakeholders? 
- Imagine the problem from the perspective of each stakeholder 

## Identify Solutions

With the research in 


A few questions to consider...
- How do the stakeholders currently solve the problem? 
- Why is the problem important to each stakeholder? 
- How might we address the problem? 



## Finalize Problem and Solution

At this stage you will finalize your idea for the web application. Taking into account the various brainstorm sessions and the research conducted, work to specify your idea in the framework of problem & solution. 

A few questions to consider...
- Can your initial problem be reframed? 
- What is the key problem being addressed? 
- Can your problem or solution be specified? 

When your group reaches a conclusion, answer the following questions in your Ideation Google Doc:
- What problem are you solving? 
- What is your solution? 
- In one sentence, what are you building? 
- Who will benefit from your service? 
- What are the ethical implications of your service? 

It's okay if throughout this Act your problem and solution evolve. Just be sure to update your Ideation document to reflect the iterations.
