# Welcome to the backend track!

As the Software Architect, you will be responsible for the design of your app's data and how your app's data flows throughout your system. You'll also be responsible for making some important business decisions on what the data you want to collect and how the data will be used in your app.

In order to be successful at being a Software Architect, we need to get acquainted with the following:

- Databases and Models
- How Models work with Django
- Tools that will help us access our data
- Important Database rules to keep our data consistent
- Relational databases and data

After completing these five mini-lessons, it will be clear why the role as a Software Architect is so important in the overall design of our app, as well as, gaining some fundamental knowledge of backend app design.

And unlike Ted in the Dilbert comic, you'll be writing some code. Let's get started! :)
