# About Making with Code

Shuyuan Computer Science is a project based course based in Constructionism. The central goal is to create a rich, diverse community of students making powerful things with code. It is designed to help all students learn to interact with code as an expressive, evocative medium, which helps to structure thought. At its heart, computer science is about getting to know powerful ideas. This happens best when students are working on projects that matter to them. 

This course is designed for students who have no prior formal exposure to computer science. Students learn the basic principles and practices of computing while developing their computational thinking skills. They learn to program through hands-on labs and open-ended, personal projects. 

The content is structured as a set of modular components which can be flexibly composed to meet the needs and priorities of each cohort. Units include animation, data science, games, web apps, and more. 

This course follows the Making with Code curriculum, a project in collaboration with ISF and the Transformative Learning Technologies Lab (TLTL).
