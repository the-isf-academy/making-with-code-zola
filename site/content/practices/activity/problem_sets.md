# Problem Sets

There will be regularly-assigned problem sets supporting students in practicing their skills. (We should assess school culture, but I like the idea of having a small problem set due in each day of class). Students may work together on these, but they must be coded independently. Problem sets will be assessed automatically so that students get immediate feedback. Generally, problem sets will lag behind labs so that they are practice with content we’ve already explored together.

Update this. We didn't give problem sets this year, and problem sets differ
meaningfully from homework. Homework should extend and practice what we've
already learned in class; everyone should be able to complete it on their own. 

Problem sets, in contrast, are equivalent to labs, but focus on mathematical or
algorithmic ideas rather than programming. They are introduced in CS10.
